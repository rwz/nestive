module Nestive

  # The Nestive LayoutHelper provides a handful of helper methods for use in your layouts and views.
  #
  # See the documentation for each individual method for detailed information, but at a high level,
  # your parent layouts define `area`s of content. You can define an area and optionally add content
  # to it at the same time using either a String, or a block:
  #
  #     # app/views/layouts/global.html.erb
  #     <html>
  #       <head>
  #         <title><%= area :title, "MySite.com" %></title>
  #       </head>
  #       <body>
  #         <div id="content">
  #           <%= area :content %>
  #         </div>
  #         <div id="sidebar">
  #           <%= area :sidebar do %>
  #             <h2>About MySite.com</h2>
  #             <p>...</p>
  #           <% end %>
  #         </div>
  #       </body>
  #     </html>
  #
  # Your child layouts (or views) inherit and modify the parent by wrapping in an `extends` block
  # helper. You can then either `append`, `prepend` or `replace` the content that has previously
  # been assigned to each area by parent layouts.
  #
  # The `append`, `prepend` or `replace` helpers are *similar* to Rails' own `content_for`, which
  # accepts content for the named area with either a String or with a block). They're different to
  # `content_for` because they're only used modify the content assigned to the area, not retrieve it:
  #
  #     # app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb
  #     <%= extends :global do %>
  #       <% prepend :title, "Admin :: " %>
  #       <% replace :sidebar do %>
  #         <h2>Quick Links</h2>
  #         <ul>
  #           <li>...</li>
  #         </ul>
  #       <% end %>
  #     <% end %>
  #
  #     # app/views/admin/posts/index.html.erb
  #     <%= extends :admin do %>
  #       <% prepend :title, "Posts ::" %>
  #       <% replace :content do %>
  #         Normal view stuff goes here.
  #       <% end %>
  #     <% end %>
