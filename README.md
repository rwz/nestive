# Nestive
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwz/nestive.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rwz/nestive)
## A Nested Inheritable Layouts Plugin for Rails


Nestive adds powerful layout and view helpers to your Rails app. It's similar to the nested layout technique [already documented in the Rails guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-nested-layouts) and found in many other nested layout plugins (a technique using `content_for` and rendering the parent layout at the end of the child layout). There's a bunch of problems with this technique, including:

* you can only *append* content to the content buffer with `content_for` (you can't prepend to content, you can't replace it)
* when combined with this nested layout technique, `content_for` actually *prepends* new content to the buffer, because each parent layout is rendered *after* it's child

Nestive is *better* because it addresses these problems.

## Just five methods (so far) – `area`, `extends`, `append`, `prepend`, `replace`.

### Declaring an area of content in your parent layout with `area`:

The `area` helper is a lot like Rails' own `<%= yield :foo %>`, and is used in layouts to define and render a chunk of content in your layout:

``` erb
<%= area :sidebar %>
```

Unlike `yield`, `area` will allow your parent layouts to add content to the area at the same time using either a String or a block:

``` erb
<%= area :sidebar, "Some Content Here" %>

<%= area :sidebar do %>
  Some Content Here
<% end %>
```

It's important to note that this isn't *default* content, it *is* the content (unless a child changes it).

### Appending content to an area:

The implementation details are quite different, but the `append` helper works much like Rails' built-in `content_for`. It will work with either a String or block, adding the new content onto the end of any content previously provided by parent layouts:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
  <% append :sidebar, "More content." %>
  <% append :sidebar do %>
    More content.
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

### Prepending content to an area:

Exactly what you think it is. The reverse of `append` (duh), adding the new content at the start of any content previously provided by parent layouts:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
  <%= prepend :sidebar, "Content." %>
  <%= prepend :sidebar do %>
    Content.
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

### Replacing content

You can also replace any content provided by parent layouts:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
  <%= replace :sidebar, "New content." %>
  <%= replace :sidebar do %>
    New content.
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

### Extending a layout in a child layout (or view):

Any layout (or view) can declare that it wants to inherit from and extend a parent layout, in this case we're extending `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
   ...
<% end %>
```

You can nest many levels deep:

`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

``` erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <%= area :head do %>
        <title><%= area :title, 'Nestive' %></title>
      <% end %>
    </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

`app/views/layouts/with_sidebar.html.erb`:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
  <div class="sidebar"><%= area(:sidebar) do %>
    here goes sidebar
  <% end %></div>
  <%= yield -%>
<% end %>
```

`app/views/layouts/blog_posts.html.erb`:

``` erb
<%= extends :with_sidebar do %>
  <% append :sidebar do %>
    Blog archive:
    <%= render_blog_archive %>
  <% end %>

  <% append :head do %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'fancy_blog_archive_tag_cloud' %>
  <% end %>

  <%= yield %>
<% end %>
```

## The token blog example

Set-up a global layout defining some content areas.

`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

``` erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title><%= area :title, "JustinFrench.com" %></title>
  <meta name="description" content="<%= area :description, "This is my website." %>">
  <meta name="keywords" content="<%= area :keywords, "justin, french, ruby, design" %>">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
      <%= area :content do %>
        <p>Default content goes here.</p>
      <% end %>
    </div>
    <div id="sidebar">
      <%= area :sidebar do %>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>...</p>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, we set-up a `blog` layout that extends `application`, replacing, appending & prepending content to the areas we defined earlier.

`app/views/layouts/blog.html.erb`:

``` erb
<%= extends :application do %>
  <% replace :title, "My Blog – " %>
  <% replace :description, "Justin French blogs here on Ruby, Rails, Design, Formtastic, etc" %>
  <% prepend :keywords, "blog, weblog, design links, ruby links, formtastic release notes, " %>
  <%= yield %>
<% end %>
```

Now in our blog index view we can use `blog` layout and fill in the areas with content specific to the index action.


`app/views/posts/index.html.erb`:

``` erb
<% replace :content do %>
  <h1>My Blog</h1>
  <%= render @articles %>
<% end %>

<% append :sidebar do %>
  <h2>Blog Roll</h2>
  <%= render @links %>
<% end %>
```

We also need to instruct the `PostsController` to use this `blog` layout:

`app/controllers/posts_controller.rb`:

``` ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  layout 'blog'
end
```


## Installation

* add `gem 'nestive', '~> 0.2'` to your Gemfile
* run `bundle`

## Compatibility

Nestive should work properly with any Rails 3.*. It should probably work with 2.* too, but we don't have test coverage for this.

*Nestive doesn't monkey patch or fiddle with any default behaviors in Rails.* Use it when you want to, don't when you don't.
